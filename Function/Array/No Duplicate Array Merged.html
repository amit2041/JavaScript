            //Question
            You have been provided with two arrays your task is to merge both arrays while removing the duplicate elements from the merged array.

Expected Input
 arr1= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
 arr2 = [5,6,7,8,9]
Expected Output
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Note
The order of the elements should be preserved, i.e., The elements of the final array should be in the same order as they were present in the merging array.
Test Cases
Merge arr1 and arr2
Find all the duplicate elements from the new array and keep the order of the elements the same
Return the new array

        -->
        <script>
            arr1 = [1,2,4,5,7];
arr2 = [3,4,6,7,9,0];
function mergeArray(arr1,arr2){
    // Concatenate both arrays
    const mergedArray = arr1.concat(arr2);

    // Use a Set to remove duplicate elements while preserving order
    const uniqueArray = [...new Set(mergedArray)];

    return uniqueArray;
}
console.log(mergeArray(arr1,arr2));
//Output : [1,2,4,5,7,3,6,9,0]
        </script>
