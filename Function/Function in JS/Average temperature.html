            //Question
            Suppose you're given an array of objects representing the weather conditions of different cities. Create a function with name calculateAverage that takes threshold pressure as a parameter and returns the average temperature of the cities with a pressure value above a certain threshold.



Requirements

The function should have access to the weather object. Specifically, your code should be able to:
Filter out the objects with a pressure value equal to or above the given threshold. 
Map each object to create array of temperature. 
Reduce the temperature values to find the total temperature of the remaining cities. 
Calculate the average temperature and return the average temperature from the calculateAverage function.
The average temperature should be up to 1 decimal place i.e. the value should be like "45.3"


The array is of the format:

[
     { city: 'New York', temperature: 50, pressure: 1015 },

     { city: 'Los Angeles', temperature: 70, pressure: 1010 },

     { city: 'Chicago', temperature: 40, pressure: 1012 },

     { city: 'Houston', temperature: 75, pressure: 1020 },

     { city: 'Miami', temperature: 80, pressure: 1017 },
]

        -->
        <script>
              const weather = [
      { city: "New York", temperature: 50, pressure: 1015 },
      { city: "Los Angeles", temperature: 70, pressure: 1010 },
      { city: "Chicago", temperature: 40, pressure: 1012 },
      { city: "Houston", temperature: 75, pressure: 1020 },
      { city: "Miami", temperature: 80, pressure: 1017 }
    ];
    const pressureThreshold = 1015;
    function calculateAverage(pressureThreshold){
      //Implement your function here
        const filteredCities = weather.filter(city => city.pressure >= pressureThreshold);
  const temperatures = filteredCities.map(city => city.temperature);
  const totalTemperature = temperatures.reduce((acc, temp) => acc + temp, 0);
  const averageTemperature = totalTemperature / filteredCities.length;
  return averageTemperature.toFixed(1);
    }
    console.log(calculateAverage(pressureThreshold))
    //Output : 68.3
        </script>
