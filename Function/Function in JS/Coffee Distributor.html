            //Question
            Suppose you're working on a project where you need to process a list of customer orders for a coffee shop.



Requirements

Requirement 1:

Each order is represented as an object with the following properties:

"orderNumber" - a unique number identifying the order
"items" - an array of objects representing the items ordered, where each item has a "name" and a "price" property
"discountCode" - a string representing a discount code for the order (optional)

Requirement 2:

You need to write a function "totalOrderValue" that takes an array of order objects and a callback function as its input and returns the total value of all orders combined after applying any applicable discounts.
The callback function, named "applyDiscount" should take two parameters: a discount code and total order value for a particular object, and applies the discount based on the following condition.
If the discount code is "COFFEELOVER," apply a 10% discount.

If the discount code is “TEALOVER,” apply a 20% discount.
There may be cases where there is no discount code present in the order object.


Note:

You must use the map and reduce function to iterate over every object and to get the total value.
The final ans should be converted to 2 decimal places.

          { name: "Chocolate Croissant", price: 2.5 }

      },
      {
        orderNumber: 2,
        items: [
          { name: "Latte", price: 4.0 },

      orderTotal = applyDiscount(order.discountCode, orderTotal);
    }
    return orderTotal;
