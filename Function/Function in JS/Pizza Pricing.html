            //Question
            You are tasked with creating a program to calculate the price of a pizza based on its size, quantity and selected toppings.



Objectives
The pricing is determined as follows:
- The base price of the pizza depends on its size, which can be small, medium, or large.
Small: $8.00
Medium: $10.00
Large: $12.00
- Each topping selected for the pizza incurs an additional cost of $1.50 per topping.
Write a JavaScript function pizzaPricing, that takes the size of the pizza as a parameter in form of string and returns a curried function.
The curried function should take an array of selected toppings as a parameter and return another function. The final function should take the quantity of pizzas as a parameter, calculate the total price and return the total price.
Implement the pizzaPricing function and ensure that the returned function correctly calculates the total price based on the given parameters. 
Expected Input

Pizza = Large;
Toppings = bacon , cheese
Expected Output

15

Note:
The final result should be up to 2 decimal places.
function pricePricing(pizzaSize){
    return function(toppings){
        return function(pizzaQuantity){
            const totalPrice = pizzaSize + toppings + pizzaQuantity;
            return totalPrice;
        }
    }
}

  

        -->
        <script>
            function pizzaPricing(size) {
    // Define base prices for different sizes
    let basePrice;
    switch (size.toLowerCase()) {
        case 'small':
            basePrice = 8.00;
            break;
        case 'medium':
            basePrice = 10.00;
            break;
        case 'large':
            basePrice = 12.00;
            break;
        default:
            throw new Error('Invalid pizza size');
    }

    // Return a curried function to calculate total price
    return function (toppings) {
        // Calculate topping cost based on the number of toppings
        let toppingCost = toppings.length * 1.50;
        
        // Return a function to calculate total price based on quantity
        return function (quantity) {
            // Calculate total price including base price, topping cost, and quantity
            let totalPrice = (basePrice + toppingCost) * quantity;
            // Format total price to 2 decimal places
            return totalPrice.toFixed(2);
        };
    };
}

// Example usage:
const calculatePrice = pizzaPricing('Large')(['bacon', 'cheese']);
console.log(calculatePrice(1)); // Output: 15.00
