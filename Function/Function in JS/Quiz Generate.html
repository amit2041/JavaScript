            //Question
            You have been assigned the task of developing a software system for an online examination that generates question papers for various subjects. The system should be able to shuffle the questions within each subject every time a question paper is generated, ensuring that the order of the questions is randomized for each student.



Requirements

Develop a function named "shuffle" that accepts an array as its input.
This function should return another function.
The returned function should be able to produce a shuffled version of the original array whenever it is called.
You have the flexibility to choose a meaningful name for the returned function.


Input:

const func = shuffle(questions)
const shuffledArray1 = func();
const shuffledArray2 = func();


Output:

shuffleArray1 : [ 'Question5', 'Question3', 'Question1', 
'Question4', 'Question2' ]
shuffleArray2 : [ 'Question3', 'Question1', 'Question4', 
'Question5', 'Question2' ]

        -->
        <script>
            function main(questions) {
    function shuffle(arr) {
        return function() {
            // Create a copy of the original array to avoid modifying it directly
            const result = [...arr];
            
            // Shuffle the copied array using Fisher-Yates algorithm
            for (let i = result.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
                const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
                [result[i], result[j]] = [result[j], result[i]];
            }
            
            return result;
        };
    }

    return shuffle(questions);
}

// Example usage:
const questions = [
    "Question1",
    "Question2",
    "Question3",
    "Question4",
    "Question5"
];

const shuffleQuestions = main(questions);

const shuffledArray1 = shuffleQuestions();
const shuffledArray2 = shuffleQuestions();

console.log('shuffleArray1:', shuffledArray1);
console.log('shuffleArray2:', shuffledArray2);
