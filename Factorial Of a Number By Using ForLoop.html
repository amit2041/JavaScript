            //Question
            You are building a program to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Write a JavaScript function using a for loop that takes a positive integer as input and returns its factorial.

Expected Input
6
Expected Output
720
Test Cases
Use for loop to iterate from 1 up to the given number
Calculate and store the factorial of the number in answer

        -->
        <script>
       /*     function factorial(limit) {
    let answer = 1;

    // Use a for loop to iterate from 1 up to the given number
    for (let i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {
        // Multiply the current number (i) with the answer
        answer *= i;
    }

    return answer;
}
*/
// without using function
let answer = 1;
//let limit = 6;
let limit = prompt('Enter a number');
for(let i = 1; i<= limit; i++){
    answer*= i;
}
console.log(answer);
