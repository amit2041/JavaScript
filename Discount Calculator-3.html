            //Question
            You run an e-commerce website where you offer different discounts based on the amount purchased by the customer.

Create a program that calculates the discount offer depending on the given amount and store the calculated discount in the discount variable

Test Cases:-

Use the following conditions to calculate the discount.

1- If the amount is less than 500, then the value of the discount should be "No Discount." 

2- If the amount is greater than or equal to 500 and less than 1000, then the value of the discount should be "10% Discount."

3- If the amount is greater than or equal to 1000 and less than 2000, then the value of the discount should be "20% Discount."

4- If the amount is greater than or equal to 2000 and less than 4000, then the value of the discount should be "30% Discount."

5- If the amount is greater than or equal to 4000 and less than 5000, then the value of the discount should be "40% Discount."

6- If the amount is greater than or equal to 5000, then the value of the discount should be "50% Discount."
Note:
You must use switch statements to test the conditions.
