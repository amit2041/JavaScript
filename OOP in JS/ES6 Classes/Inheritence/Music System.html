            //Question
            Suppose you are building a music streaming application that allows 
            users to listen to different types of music.

You want to create a class hierarchy to represent the different types of music available for streaming.



Objective:

Create a class hierarchy with the following classes:

1- Media (base class)

a- Song (inherits from Media)
-PopSong (inherits from Song)
-RockSong (inherits from Song)

b- Podcast (inherits from Media)
-NewsPodcast (inherits from Podcast)
-ComedyPodcast (inherits from Podcast)

c- The Media class should have the following properties:
-title (string)
-artist (string)
-duration</b> (number)

d- The Media class should also have the following methods:
- getTitle() - returns the title of the media.
- getArtist() - returns the artist of the media.
- getDuration() - returns the duration of the media.
2- The Song class should have the following additional properties:

- album (string)
- genre (string)
3- The Song class should also have the following additional methods:

- getAlbum() - returns the album of the song
- getGenre() - returns the genre of the song
4- The Podcast class should have the following additional properties:

- host (string)
- topic (string)
5- The Podcast class should also have the following additional methods:

- getHost() - returns the host of the podcast.
- getTopic() - returns the topic of the podcast.
6- The PopSong class should have the following additional properties:

 - danceability (number)
 - energy (number)
7- The PopSong class should also have the following additional methods:

- getDanceability() - returns the danceability of the pop song.
- getEnergy() - returns the energy of the pop song.
8- The RockSong class should have the following additional properties:

- distortion (number).
- tempo (number).
9- The RockSong class should also have the following additional methods:

- getDistortion()- returns the distortion of the rock song.
- getTempo() - returns the tempo of the rock song.
10- The NewsPodcast class should have the following additional properties:

- source (string).
- rating (number). 
11- The NewsPodcast class should also have the following additional methods:

- getSource() - returns the source of the news podcast.
- getDuration() - returns the duration of the news podcast.
12- The ComedyPodcast class should have the following additional properties:

- comedian (string)
- rating (number)
13- The ComedyPodcast class should also have the following additional methods:

- getComedian() - returns the comedian of the comedy podcast</br>
- getRating() - returns the rating of the comedy podcast</br>

Note:
- Each object should be able to access its parent properties and methods.
- Your code will be evaluated on this basis only.
