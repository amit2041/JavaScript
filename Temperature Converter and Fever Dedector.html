            //Question
            Create a program that determines if a patient has a fever based on their body temperature reading.

Test Cases:-

There should be a correctly defined temperature function.

a- Apply the required conversion formula to convert the tempF value in Fahrenheit to Celsius and store the result in a new variable. 

b- Then apply the if condition to check whether the converted value is greater than or equal to 37. 

c- If the value is greater than or equal to 37 then in "result" it should store that "you have got a fever" with the temperature value converted to one decimal place.

d- If the value is less than 37 then in "result" it should store that "you don't have a fever" with the temperature value converted to one decimal place.
Hints:-

To round the converted temperature to one decimal place using the toFixed() method.


        -->
        <script>
            function main(tempF) {
  let result;

  function convertToFahrenheitToCelsius(tempF) {
        return (tempF - 32) * 5 / 9;
    }

    // Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and round to one decimal place
    let tempC = convertToFahrenheitToCelsius(tempF).toFixed(1);

    // Check if the converted temperature is greater than or equal to 37

    if (tempC >= 37) {
        result = "You have a fever. Your temperature is " + tempC + "Â°C.";
    } else {
        result = "You don't have a fever. Your temperature is " + tempC + "Â°C.";
    }
