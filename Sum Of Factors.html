        <script>
            function sumOfFactors(number) {
    let answer = 0;

    // Iterate from 1 to the given number
    for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
        // Check if 'i' is a factor of the given number
        if (number % i === 0) {
            // If 'i' is a factor, add it to the sum
            answer += i;
