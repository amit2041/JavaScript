            //Question
            Create a Compound Interest program that calculates the total amount accumulated after a certain period based on the following attributes:

a. principalAmount: The principal value deposited

b. annualInterestRate: Interest rate per year

c.  numberOfYears: Period for which interest has to be given. 
Note
Do not use toFixed or round off the answer.
You need to use the for loop approach for this question.
Sample Input
principalAmount : 500$
annualInterestRate : 0.08 (8% converted to decimal value)
numberOfYears : 5
Sample Output
734.66
Test Cases
 a- You must calculate the total amount accumulated based on the given attributes.
 b- Store the final amount in the "answer" variable.
function compoundInterest (principalAmount , annualInterestRate , numberOfYears){ 
    let answer;
 //Write your code here
    answer = principalAmount;

    // Convert annual interest rate to decimal
    let rate = 1 + annualInterestRate;

    // Calculate compound interest using for loop
    for (let i = 0; i < numberOfYears; i++) {
        answer *= rate;
    }

  return answer;

}
Compound Interest Formula: 
A = P(1 + R/100)^n
A = total amount accumulated after a certain period
P = principalAmount
R = Rate of Interest
n = Number of years
